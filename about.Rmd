I created this site as a way to display and share the results from my personal project during my time as an intern at Oracle for Startups. I wanted to look at the microbiome because it is a recent field with a lot of new and exciting research. The human microbiome has also been linked to good health by a variety of studies. 

My goal was to look at how different factors can affect the human microbiome. So far, I have looked at diet and how it affects the gut microbiome, which you can view by selecting the 'diet' tab.

My name is Jaden and I currently work as an intern at Oracle for Startups. I am in my final year of school at the University of Virginia studying Biomedical Engineering with a minor in Data Science. After graduation, I hope to continue what i've learned at Oracle and start my career in a bioinformatics-related field. I am from the beach and love being outdoors, and spending time hiking or doing yoga.
